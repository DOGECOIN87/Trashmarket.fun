# Trashmarket.fun Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the critical steps and fixes required to finalize the Trashmarket.fun dApp for production, specifically focusing on the DEX, JunkPusher, and Bridge features.

## 1. DEX / Swap Functionality
The DEX is currently a "read-only" UI. To make it fully functional, the following actions are required:

- [ ] **Obtain Trashbin Dex IDL/SDK:** The codebase lacks the Anchor IDL or SDK for the "Trashbin Dex CPAMM v4" program. This is required to build the actual swap instructions.
- [ ] **Implement `transactionBuilder.ts` for DEX:** Once the IDL is obtained, implement the `buildSwapTransaction` function.
- [ ] **Integrate Treasury Fee:** Implement the logic to divert a percentage of each swap to the Treasury Wallet (`77hDeRmTFa7WVPqTvDtD9qg9D73DdqU3WeaHTxUnQ8wb`).
- [ ] **Connect UI to Wallet:** Replace the `alert()` in `Dex.tsx` with a real transaction flow using the `useWallet` hook.
- [ ] **Slippage & Price Impact:** Ensure the UI correctly handles slippage protection and displays accurate price impact warnings.

## 2. JunkPusher Game Economy
The game is partially integrated but needs refinement to be "production-ready":

- [ ] **Switch to JUNK Token:** Ensure all game interactions (drops, bumps) use the JUNK SPL token (`BgvprjyRDq1erzQocRTmLPBzMuEmcARg64LE9eGX9XRF`) instead of native GOR where applicable.
- [ ] **Verify On-Chain Logic:** Test the `recordCoinCollection` and `recordScore` transactions on the Gorbagana network.
- [ ] **Balance Management:** Finalize the deposit/withdrawal UI to allow players to move JUNK tokens in and out of the game state.
- [ ] **Leaderboard Integration:** Ensure the high score service correctly fetches and displays the on-chain leaderboard.

## 3. Gorbagana-Solana Bridge
The bridge has critical implementation bugs that must be fixed:

- [ ] **Fix `createOrder` Logic:** Correct the `bridgeService.ts` to pass the required accounts (escrow, maker ATA, etc.) instead of placeholders.
- [ ] **Fix Parameter Mismatch:** Resolve the discrepancy between the Gorbagana program (which expects a `direction` byte) and the Solana program (which expects a `recipient` pubkey).
- [ ] **Implement Fill/Cancel UI:** Add user-friendly buttons and status indicators for filling and cancelling bridge orders.
- [ ] **Mainnet Deployment:** Deploy the Solana-side bridge program to Mainnet (currently on Devnet).

## 4. General Production Finalization
- [ ] **Environment Variables:** Ensure all Program IDs and RPC endpoints are correctly set in the production `.env` file.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Implement robust error boundaries and user-friendly toast notifications for failed transactions.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization:** Verify the brutalist UI remains functional and readable on mobile devices (Backpack mobile).
- [ ] **Security Audit:** Review the `BRIDGE_SECURITY.md` and ensure all escrow logic is sound.
